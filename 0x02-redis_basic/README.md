# Redis Basic Operations and Cache Implementation

## Overview

This project focuses on basic operations with Redis, a powerful in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. The project includes various tasks to implement Redis functionality in Python, such as storing data, retrieving data, counting method calls, storing lists, and more.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to use Redis for basic operations.
- Implement Redis as a simple cache.
- Learn to use the Redis Python client.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- PEP 8 style guide compliance
- Modules, classes, and functions must be documented.
- Functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

## Installation

1. **Install Redis Server:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y install redis-server
   ```

2. **Install Redis Python Client:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install redis
   ```

3. **Modify Redis Configuration:**
   ```bash
   sudo sed -i "s/bind .*/bind 127.0.0.1/g" /etc/redis/redis.conf
   ```

4. **Start Redis Server (in a container or otherwise):**
   ```bash
   sudo service redis-server start
   ```

## Tasks

### 0. Writing Strings to Redis

Create a `Cache` class that connects to Redis and provides a method to store data. The `store` method generates a random key and stores the input data.

**File:** `exercise.py`

### 1. Reading from Redis and Recovering Original Type

Implement a `get` method in the `Cache` class to retrieve data, with an optional callable to convert the data back to the desired format. Include `get_str` and `get_int` methods for specific type retrieval.

**File:** `exercise.py`

### 2. Incrementing Values

Implement a `count_calls` decorator to count the number of times methods are called. Use the `INCR` command to increment counts.

**File:** `exercise.py`

### 3. Storing Lists

Create a `call_history` decorator to log input and output of functions to separate Redis lists. Decorate the `store` method with this decorator.

**File:** `exercise.py`

### 4. Retrieving Lists

Implement a `replay` function to display the history of calls for a specific function, using the keys generated in previous tasks.

**File:** `exercise.py`

### 5. Implementing an Expiring Web Cache and Tracker (Advanced)

Develop a `get_page` function in `web.py` to cache web pages with an expiration time of 10 seconds, tracking the number of accesses.

**File:** `web.py`

## Documentation

Each module, class, and method is documented following PEP 257 guidelines. Use the following commands to check documentation:

```bash
python3 -c 'print(__import__("exercise").__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("exercise").Cache.__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("exercise").Cache.store.__doc__)'
```
